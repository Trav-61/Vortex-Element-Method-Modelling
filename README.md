# Vortex-Element-Method-Modelling
This repository contains my Masterâ€™s dissertation from the University of Bath, completed as part of my Memg in Engineering. The project focused on vortex element modeling of wakes on tandem-wing aircraft, analyzing wake interactions and aerodynamic effects. All computational models and simulations were built from scratch in MATLAB.
